# Deploying Sitecore 9 into an App Service Environment
The templates are an exact copy of a Sitecore 9.0.2 XP Single configuration from the [Sitecore-Azure-Quickstart-Templates](https://github.com/Sitecore/Sitecore-Azure-Quickstart-Templates/) repository. I only modified the templates in order for Sitecore to be deployed into an App Service Environment.
